ShortDescription: A game for babies who like to bang on the keyboard
Description: |-
  BabySmash is a fun, educational game for babies and toddlers who love to bang on the keyboard.
  As babies or children smash on the keyboard, colored shapes, letters and numbers appear on the screen and are spoken aloud to help with letter and number recognition.
  Features include colorful shapes with happy faces, letters and numbers with text-to-speech, fun sounds and giggles, multi-monitor support, and system key lockout to prevent accidental exits.
